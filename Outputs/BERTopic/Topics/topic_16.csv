Summary: store @type and @enum strings without resolving classes, resolve later in Resolver and JsonReader, add helper methods for late class resolution, note change in changelog. This seems to be about deferring class resolution to improve parsing speed? The change is about delaying class resolution during parsing. That could be a performance improvement: by not resolving classes during parsing, you might speed up parsing. But is the primary purpose performance? The description: ""store @type and @enum strings without resolving classes"" - that is a change to parsing logic. It might be to improve performance or to fix a bug. The title ""Delay class resolution during parsing"" suggests a performance optimization. The summary doesn't mention performance explicitly, but the change is about deferring resolution. That likely improves performance. The guidelines: performance-related PRs may contain keywords like latency, optimization, slow, etc. The title doesn't contain those, but the content indicates a performance improvement. The question: ""determine whether the primary purpose of the pull request is to improve performance."" The PR is about delaying class resolution during parsing. That is likely a performance improvement. So classify as 'performance'.

This seems to be about deferring class resolution to later, which might improve performance by avoiding class loading during parsing. The description mentions performance? It doesn't explicitly mention performance, but deferring class resolution could reduce overhead during parsing, potentially improving performance. However, the classification requires keywords like memory, optimization, speed, perf, etc. The description doesn't contain those keywords. But the intent is performance improvement. The instructions: ""Performance-related pull requests may contain keywords such as memory, optimization, leak, speed, perf, stuck, lag, fast, respons, slow, latency, performance, latenc, hang, tim, throughput, compile-time-hog, instant, responsive, react, perform, wait, minor, or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs."" The description doesn't contain any of those. But the content indicates a performance improvement. The classification might still be 'performance' because the primary purpose is to improve performance. The guidelines: ""Given a text combining the title and body of a pull request, determine whether the primary purpose of the pull request is to improve performance."" So we need to decide. The title: ""Defer class resolution in parser"". That is a performance improvement. So likely 'performance'.
