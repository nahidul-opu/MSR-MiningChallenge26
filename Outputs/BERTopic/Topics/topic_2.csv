3273233066,1037,feat: implement comprehensive species tracking system with seasonal/yearly detection badges,"## Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive species tracking system that displays visual badges on the DailySummaryCard to indicate when species are new, new this year, or new this season. The implementation includes proper database queries, caching, and UI enhancements.

## Key Features

### 🏷️ Species Tracking Badges
- **⭐ Star Icon**: Species detected for the first time ever (lifetime new)
- **📅 Calendar Icon**: Species detected for the first time this year 
- **🍃 Leaf Icon**: Species detected for the first time this season
- Each badge type has configurable time windows (default: 14 days lifetime, 30 days yearly, 21 days seasonal)

### 🗄️ Database Enhancements
- **New Method**: `GetSpeciesFirstDetectionInPeriod()` - retrieves first detection of each species within a date range
- **Improved Queries**: Separate queries for lifetime vs. seasonal/yearly tracking for better accuracy
- **Better Performance**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing

### 📊 API Improvements  
- **Enhanced Analytics**: `/api/v2/analytics/species/daily` now includes tracking status fields
- **Date-based Status**: Species status computed relative to selected date, not current date
- **Comprehensive Response**: Added `is_new_species`, `is_new_this_year`, `is_new_this_season` fields

### 🎨 Frontend Updates
- **Animated Icons**: Smooth CSS animations for badge appearance/disappearance  
- **Smart Display**: Badges only shown when species qualify for ""new"" status
- **Responsive Design**: Icons adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper tooltips and semantic markup

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 15+ test scenarios covering edge cases
- **Integration Tests**: Real database interactions with SQLite
- **Mock Implementations**: Complete test helpers for all datastore methods
- **Race Condition Testing**: Concurrent access validation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New method for period-specific queries
GetSpeciesFirstDetectionInPeriod(startDate, endDate, limit, offset)
-- Returns first detection of each species within the date range
```

### Configuration
```yaml
realtime:
  species_tracking:
    enabled: true
    new_species_window_days: 14    # Lifetime tracking window
    yearly_tracking:
      enabled: true
      window_days: 30              # Yearly tracking window  
    seasonal_tracking:
      enabled: true
      window_days: 21              # Seasonal tracking window
```

### API Response Format
```json
{
  ""species"": [
    {
      ""common_name"": ""Eurasian Blackcap"",
      ""is_new_species"": true,        # ⭐ Star badge
      ""is_new_this_year"": false,     # 📅 Calendar badge
      ""is_new_this_season"": true,    # 🍃 Leaf badge
      ""days_since_first"": 2,
      ""days_this_year"": 45,
      ""days_this_season"": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Bug Fixes
- **Seasonal Data Loading**: Fixed issue where seasonal tracking showed all species as ""new this season""
- **Date Calculations**: Corrected DaysThisYear computation for accurate year tracking
- **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed cache not clearing on year/season transitions
- **Mock Updates**: Updated all test mocks to include new interface methods

## Files Changed
- **Frontend**: DailySummaryCard.svelte, DashboardPage.svelte, types, styles
- **Backend**: Species tracker, analytics API, datastore methods, configuration
- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and mock tests
- **Documentation**: Updated configuration examples and API documentation

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ New integration tests with real database
- ✅ Mock implementations updated
- ✅ Manual testing with API endpoints
- ✅ Race condition testing for concurrent access

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Migration Notes
- New configuration options are optional with sensible defaults
- Database schema changes are additive (new method only)
- API response includes new fields but doesn't remove existing ones

3219254404,286,Reimplement hydration using new diffing/committing architecture,"## Summary

Reimplements hydration in `src/crank.ts` to work with the new diffing/committing separation architecture. The previous hydration logic was commented out and non-functional. This implementation enables parallel hydration of sibling components and provides graceful fallback for hydration mismatches.

## Key Changes

### Core Implementation
- **Reimplement `Renderer.hydrate()` method** that was previously throwing ""Reimplement hydration"" error
- **Add hydration tracking to Retainer class** with `IsHydrating` flag and `hydrationData` property
- **Integrate with new architecture** using existing `diffChildren`/`commitChildren` rather than old monolithic approach

### Hydration Flow
- **Initialize hydration context** by calling `renderer.hydrate()` for root element to get DOM children
- **Propagate hydration state** through retainer tree via `IsHydrating` flag
- **Assign DOM nodes in order** during diffing phase using `getNextHydrationChild()` helper
- **Pass hydration data** to `text()` and `raw()` renderer calls during commit phase

### Error Handling & Fallback
- **Detect tag mismatches** when `renderer.hydrate()` returns `undefined`
- **Clear hydration flag** and fall back to regular rendering for mismatched subtrees
- **Handle missing DOM children** gracefully without breaking rendering
- **Enable hydration warnings** for debugging mismatch scenarios

### Parallel Sibling Support
The new implementation addresses the requirement that **sibling components no longer need to hydrate serially**:
- DOM nodes are assigned during synchronous diffing phase
- Async components can render in parallel during commit phase  
- Hydration data consumption maintains proper order without blocking

## Component Support
- ✅ **Function components** (sync & async)
- ✅ **Generator components** (sync & async)
- ✅ **Fragment components** 
- ✅ **Raw elements** with HTML injection
- ✅ **Event handler preservation** during hydration
- ✅ **Component refresh** after hydration

## Testing
Unskipped and fixed multiple hydration test cases:
- Basic element hydration (`simple`)
- Component hydration (`sync function component`, `sync generator component`, `async function component`)
- Fragment hydration (`fragment`)
- Mismatch handling (`mismatched tag`, `mismatched text`) 
- Advanced scenarios (`async sibling components resolve out of order`, `raw element`, `refresh`)

## Example Usage

```jsx
// Before: throws ""Reimplement hydration"" error
renderer.hydrate(<button onclick={handleClick}>Click</button>, document.body);

// After: successfully hydrates existing DOM
document.body.innerHTML = ""<button>Click</button>"";
const button = document.body.firstChild;
renderer.hydrate(<button onclick={handleClick}>Click</button>, document.body);
// Preserves existing DOM node and adds event handler
console.log(document.body.firstChild === button); // true
```

## Breaking Changes
None - this implements previously non-functional hydration without changing existing APIs.

Fixes the hydration system to work with the modern Crank architecture while maintaining backward compatibility and improving performance through parallel sibling hydration.

*This pull request was created as a result of the following prompt from Copilot chat.*
> The goal is to reimplement hydration in src/crank.ts. The current hydration logic is commented out or non-functional, and several hydration-related tests in test/hydration.tsx are skipped (such as mismatched tag and mismatched text tests). Now that diffing and committing are done in two separate steps, hydrating sibling components does not need to be run in series. 
> 
> Steps to complete:
> 1. Review the old hydration implementation (search for commented-out or stubbed hydration code in src/crank.ts).
> 2. Restore or rewrite the hydration logic so that it works with the new diffing/committing separation and does not require serial hydration of siblings.
> 3. Ensure that skipped hydration tests in test/hydration.tsx (such as ""mismatched tag"" and ""mismatched text"") can be unskipped and pass.
> 4. Refactor or clean up any legacy or unnecessary code from the old hydration logic if present.
> 5. Ensure all relevant hydration tests pass, including edge cases of mismatches and raw element hydration.
> 
> References:
> - src/crank.ts for main hydration logic
> - test/hydration.tsx for hydration-related tests
> - The new structure where diffing and committing are separate
> - It is no longer necessary to hydrate sibling components in series
> 
> Do not change other unrelated code.
> 
> If possible, add comments explaining new or tricky logic in the hydration implementation.

3145777953,2828,feat: Cache RPC health check in local storage for 1 hour,"This PR implements caching for RPC health check data to prevent unnecessary API calls on every page load.

## Changes

- **Added cache key utility**: Added `rpcHealthCacheKey` function to generate consistent cache keys for each network
- **Implemented caching functions**: Created `getLocalRpcHealthCache` and `setLocalRpcHealthCache` functions with 1-hour expiration logic
- **Modified RPC endpoint initialization**: Updated `getInitialRpcEndpoints` to check cache before making API calls
- **Added cache validation**: Includes timestamp validation and automatic cleanup of expired/invalid cache entries

## Behavior

The caching mechanism works as follows:

1. **Cache check**: Before calling the staking API, check if valid cached health data exists (within 1 hour)
2. **Use cached data**: If fresh cached data is available, use it instead of making an API call
3. **Fetch and cache**: If cache is missing or expired, fetch from API and cache the result with timestamp
4. **Cache cleanup**: Automatically removes expired or corrupted cache entries

## Benefits

- **Reduced API calls**: Prevents redundant health checks on every page load
- **Improved performance**: Faster app initialization when using cached data
- **Bandwidth savings**: Reduces network requests to the staking API
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to API calls when cache is unavailable

The cache stores health data with a timestamp and automatically expires after 1 hour, ensuring data freshness while providing performance benefits.

Fixes #2827.

3075207290,510,Avoid reopening /dev/kvm or /dev/mshv for every new sandbox,"This PR implements a solution to avoid reopening `/dev/kvm` or `/dev/mshv` device files for every new sandbox. Previously, each time a new sandbox was created, a new file handle was opened, causing unnecessary file operations.

## Implementation details:

1. Added static globals with `OnceLock` to cache hypervisor handles:
   - `KVM_HANDLE` in the KVM module
   - `MSHV_HANDLE` in the hyperv_linux module

2. Created accessor functions that initialize the handles only once:
   - `get_kvm_handle()` - returns a reference to the cached KVM handle
   - `get_mshv_handle()` - returns a reference to the cached MSHV handle

3. Modified hypervisor driver constructors to use these global handles:
   - `KVMDriver::new()` now uses the cached KVM handle
   - `HypervLinuxDriver::new()` now uses the cached MSHV handle

4. Updated `is_hypervisor_present()` functions to use the global handles

This change will significantly reduce the number of file operations, especially in scenarios that create many sandboxes (like the test that creates 1000 sandboxes).

The changes are minimal and focused specifically on caching the hypervisor handles without affecting other functionality.

Fixes #503.

3244866747,565,Fix syntax highlighting flicker by replacing PrismAsyncLight with Shiki,"# Fix syntax highlighting flicker by replacing PrismAsyncLight with Shiki

## Summary

Fixes BUS-1445 by replacing the asynchronous `PrismAsyncLight` from `react-syntax-highlighter` with Shiki's synchronous highlighting to eliminate the brief flash of unstyled code that appears before syntax highlighting loads in the reasoning slide-out component.

**Key changes:**
- Replaced `react-syntax-highlighter` with Shiki v2.5.0 
- Created `shiki-light-theme.ts` to maintain visual consistency with existing theme
- Rewrote `SyntaxHighlighter.tsx` to use Shiki's synchronous highlighting
- Removed react-syntax-highlighter dependencies from package.json
- Maintained component interface compatibility for existing usage

**Technical approach:** Shiki provides synchronous highlighting which eliminates the async loading flicker. The component now shows a brief loading state with unstyled code while Shiki initializes (much faster than PrismAsyncLight's language loading).

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The primary target component could not be tested due to authentication requirements.

- [ ] **Test reasoning slide-out component with real data** - verify syntax highlighting appears immediately without flicker when opening uncached reasoning slide-outs
- [ ] **Verify visual consistency** - compare YAML/SQL code blocks before and after to ensure theme conversion preserved styling
- [ ] **Test all existing usage locations** - check `StreamingMessageCode` and `AppCodeBlock` components still render correctly
- [ ] **Performance testing** - ensure Shiki initialization doesn't cause performance regressions compared to PrismAsyncLight
- [ ] **Language support verification** - test YAML, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and Markdown highlighting

**Recommended test plan:**
1. Open reasoning slide-out with code blocks and verify no flicker occurs
2. Test streaming vs completed message states 
3. Check code blocks in different contexts (chat, reasoning panel, etc.)
4. Verify line numbers and styling match previous implementation

## Summary by cubic
Added an optional segments prop to DataTableProvider, allowing segments to be passed directly instead of always fetching them.

- **New Features**
  - DataTableProvider now uses provided segments if available.
  - Falls back to fetching segments when the prop is not set.

### Description Of Changes

- Moves serialization of datasets, which is a synchronous and potentially long-running operation (i.e. with large datasets) to the default fastAPI threadpool to avoid blocking main thread on the `async` endpoint
- updates admin UI to call the API with `minimal=true` to avoid this codepath altogether when not needed



### Steps to Confirm

- [x] tested locally that the new FE code correctly queries for `minimal=true`on the integrations page and that successfully populates the dataset picker on the integrations page: 
<img width=""1428"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5069112c-2cef-4b2b-b368-a42f8a331400"" />
- [x] tested locally that dataset YAML editor also still works even though it uses the new query for some purpose (not exactly sure what).
    - (note: there's likely further improvements to make here, it looks like the API call to get the list of dataset records to display on the top view of the dataset page actually is getting the entire dataset definitions (not `minimal`); ideally we should just be retrieving the full dataset definition when we click into the particular dataset to edit it)

3129475228,1947,Convert RecentsSection from Client to Server Component,"# Convert RecentsSection from Client to Server Component

## Summary
Converted the `RecentsSection` component from a Client Component to a Server Component by removing client-side data fetching and replacing it with server-side data fetching using `await`.

## Changes Made
- **Removed `'use client'` directive** from both `RecentsSection.tsx` and `fetchRecentSessions.ts`
- **Updated `fetchRecentSessions` service** to use server-side Supabase client (`@/libs/db/server`)
- **Replaced client-side hooks** (`useEffect`, `useState`) with server-side data fetching
- **Modified `GlobalNav` component** to fetch recent sessions data and pass as props to `RecentsSection`
- **Removed loading state logic** as server components don't need client-side loading states

## Technical Details
- `fetchRecentSessions` now uses `await createClient()` for server-side database access
- `GlobalNav` is now an async function that fetches data before rendering
- `RecentsSection` receives sessions data via props instead of fetching client-side
- Authentication context is properly handled server-side through Supabase server client

## Files Modified
- `frontend/apps/app/components/CommonLayout/GlobalNav/services/fetchRecentSessions.ts`
- `frontend/apps/app/components/CommonLayout/GlobalNav/RecentsSection/RecentsSection.tsx`
- `frontend/apps/app/components/CommonLayout/GlobalNav/GlobalNav.tsx`

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ Linting passes (biome, TypeScript, ESLint)
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

3022909076,21585,feat: improve DAG visualization in RisingWave UI,"# Improve DAG visualization in RisingWave UI

This PR improves the visualization of DAGs in the RisingWave UI, making large and complex DAGs easier to read and interact with.

## Changes

- Replaced the current D3/dagre-based visualization with ReactFlow, which provides:
  - Adaptive layout calculation
  - Sub-DAG visualization when clicking on relations
  - Drag & drop functionality
  - Better performance with large DAGs
- Added a ""Show All Nodes"" button to reset the sub-DAG view
- Maintained existing styling and color coding for nodes and edges

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with complex DAGs to ensure readability and interaction.

### Testing Instructions

To test this implementation:

1. Start a RisingWave cluster:
```bash
./risedev d
```

2. Create test data for a complex DAG:
```bash
./risedev slt e2e_test/nexmark/create_sources.slt.part
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE TABLE dimension (v1 int);'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv AS SELECT auction.* FROM dimension join auction on auction.id-auction.id = dimension.v1;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv2 AS SELECT * FROM mv;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv3 AS SELECT count(*) FROM mv2;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv4 AS SELECT * FROM mv;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv5 AS SELECT count(*) FROM mv2;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv6 AS SELECT mv4.* FROM mv4 join mv2 using(id);'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv7 AS SELECT max(id) FROM mv;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv8 AS SELECT mv.* FROM mv join mv6 using(id);'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE SCHEMA s1;'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE TABLE s1.t1 (v1 int);'
./risedev psql -c 'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW s1.mv1 AS SELECT s1.t1.* FROM s1.t1 join mv on s1.t1.v1 = mv.id;'
./risedev psql -c 'INSERT INTO dimension select 0 from generate_series(1, 20);'
```

3. Run the dashboard:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm i
npm run dev
```

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/relation_graph/ to view the relation graph

5. Verify the following features:
   - The graph is rendered with proper layout
   - Clicking on a relation shows the sub-DAG (upstream and downstream nodes)
   - The ""Show All Nodes"" button appears when in sub-DAG view
   - Nodes can be dragged and repositioned
   - MiniMap and Controls are available for navigation

### Description:

This PR adds the `tx_index` column to the `dex.trades` table.

While `block_number` was already present, `tx_index` was missing from the final output, despite being available in base tables. This addition is crucial for accurately distinguishing transactions on chains with sub-second blocks and improves the efficiency of related spells like `dex.sandwiches` and `dex.atomic_arbitrages`.

2990501610,345,fix: 优化数据库事务处理以减少死锁和超时,"# 修复数据库死锁和超时问题

## 问题描述
当系统 src/api 并发到了个级别时，系统会持续的报数据库死锁和超时。初步判断是study/run 接口由于时间过长导致请求时间过长，当其他接口有请求导致数据库整体锁死。这时只有通过重新启动才能解决。

## 解决方案
1. 优化事务处理：将长时间运行的事务拆分为多个较小的事务，使用`db.session.begin_nested()`和`db.session.commit()`确保数据库操作及时提交
2. 改进Redis锁处理：减少锁超时时间，增加错误处理，确保锁在所有情况下都能正确释放
3. 分离长时间运行的操作：在`run_script`中，将长时间运行的LLM操作与数据库事务分离，在初始数据库操作完成后提前释放Redis锁

## 主要修改
1. `run_with_redis`函数：
   - 减少锁超时时间（最大30秒）
   - 设置阻塞超时为3秒
   - 增加全面的错误处理
   - 确保在所有情况下都能正确释放锁

2. `reset_user_study_info_by_lesson`函数：
   - 使用嵌套事务处理各个数据库操作
   - 在每个操作后立即提交事务
   - 改进错误处理

3. `get_script`函数：
   - 使用嵌套事务处理各个数据库查询
   - 在每个查询后立即提交事务
   - 增加详细的错误日志记录

4. `run_script_inner`函数：
   - 使用嵌套事务处理各个数据库操作
   - 在每个操作后立即提交事务
   - 改进错误处理

## 测试方法
添加了三个测试脚本来验证优化效果：
1. `test_concurrency.py`：模拟多个并发用户访问study/run和reset-study-progress接口
2. `monitor_db.py`：监控数据库锁和超时情况
3. `transaction_test.py`：简化测试，专注于事务处理模式的优化效果

### 生产环境测试建议
1. 部署更改到测试/预发布环境
2. 使用`monitor_db.py`脚本监控数据库锁和超时情况
3. 使用负载测试工具（如JMeter或Locust）模拟高并发访问
4. 观察系统在高并发下的表现，特别是是否还会出现死锁和超时

## 预期效果
1. 减少或消除数据库死锁和超时
2. 提高系统在高并发下的稳定性
3. 保持接口功能的一致性
4. 改善用户体验，减少系统重启次数

3161160444,177,Fix issue %23157 on GitHub,"In `packages/web/src/server/services/safe.service.ts`, a `DECIMAL_CACHE` was introduced to memoize token decimals.

*   USDC-on-Base decimals are hard-coded to 6 within the `DECIMAL_CACHE`. This eliminates an unnecessary RPC call that previously caused intermittent timeouts and a $0.00 balance display.
*   For other tokens, decimals are cached after the first successful on-chain lookup, reducing subsequent RPC calls.
*   The `getSafeBalance` function was refactored to first fetch the token balance, then retrieve decimals from the cache or by querying the chain.

3129773117,2706,Implement error node caching for improved TreeView user experience,"## Update

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/pull/2706#issuecomment-2958830169

## Overview

This PR implements error node caching functionality to significantly improve user experience when dealing with failed tree nodes in the Azure Databases extension. Previously, when nodes failed due to authentication issues or connectivity problems, every tree refresh would retry the failed operation, causing delays and poor UX when multiple nodes were affected simultaneously.

## Implementation

### Core Changes

**Enhanced `BaseCachedBranchDataProvider`:**
- Added `errorNodeCache` Map to store failed node states by parent ID
- Modified `getChildren()` to check error cache first, preventing repeated failed operations
- Added `resetNodeErrorState()` method to clear error states for retry functionality
- Enhanced cache cleanup in `refresh()` and `pruneCache()` methods
- Creates user-friendly error messages with retry buttons when operations fail

**New Retry Command:**
- Created `retryAuthentication` command that clears error state and refreshes nodes
- Smart provider detection automatically determines which branch data provider to use
- Handles both direct element retry and retry button clicks
- Registered in command system as `azureDatabases.retryAuthentication`

**Utility Functions:**
- `hasRetryNode()`: Detects error nodes by checking for IDs ending with '/reconnect'
- `createGenericElementWithContext()`: Creates tree elements with custom context values
- Comprehensive test coverage with 14 test cases

### Automatic Benefits for Target Providers

Both target providers automatically inherit the error caching functionality:
- `src/tree/azure-resources-view/cosmosdb/CosmosDBBranchDataProvider.ts`
- `src/tree/workspace-view/cosmosdb/CosmosDBWorkspaceBranchDataProvider.ts`

No changes were needed to these files since they extend the enhanced `BaseCachedBranchDataProvider`.

## User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- Failed nodes would retry connection attempts on every tree refresh
- Multiple failing nodes caused cascading delays
- No clear way to retry specific failed operations

**After:**
- Failed nodes show cached error messages instantly on refresh
- Clear ""Click here to retry"" button with refresh icon for explicit retry
- Each node can be retried independently without affecting others
- Telemetry tracking for cache usage monitoring

## Example Usage

When a connection fails due to invalid credentials:
1. Error node displays: ""Error: Authentication failed"" + ""Click here to retry"" button
2. Subsequent tree refreshes return cached error instantly (no retry attempts)
3. User clicks retry button → clears error cache → attempts fresh connection
4. If successful, normal tree structure returns; if failed, error is cached again

## Testing

- 14 comprehensive test cases covering all error caching scenarios
- Tests for cache management, retry functionality, and edge cases
- Full TypeScript compilation verification
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This implementation follows the exact pattern successfully used in the DocumentDB extension, providing the same user experience improvements while maintaining minimal code changes.

Fixes #2700.

3172600798,2387,Add ListMetadataKeys and GetAllMetadata RPC methods for improved metadata discovery,"## Problem

The existing `GetMetadata` RPC query requires users to know the specific metadata keys beforehand, which are scattered throughout the codebase. This makes it difficult for users to discover what metadata is available or to query all node metadata efficiently.

## Solution

This PR implements two new RPC methods while maintaining backward compatibility:

### 1. `ListMetadataKeys()` - Metadata Discovery
Returns all available metadata keys with human-readable descriptions:

```go
keys, err := client.ListMetadataKeys(ctx)
for _, key := range keys {
    fmt.Printf(""Key: %s - %s\n"", key.Key, key.Description)
}
```

### 2. `GetAllMetadata()` - Omni Query
Returns all node metadata in a single call, reducing round trips:

```go
metadata, err := client.GetAllMetadata(ctx)
for _, entry := range metadata {
    fmt.Printf(""%s: %v\n"", entry.Key, entry.Value)
}
```

## Key Features

- **Discoverable**: Users can explore available metadata without prior knowledge
- **Efficient**: Single call to get all metadata reduces network overhead  
- **Robust**: Gracefully handles missing or unavailable metadata keys
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing `GetMetadata` method unchanged
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive API documentation and examples

## REST Endpoints

Added convenient HTTP endpoints for web integrations:
- `GET /api/v1/metadata/keys` - Lists metadata keys with descriptions
- `GET /api/v1/metadata` - Returns available keys and RPC method info

## Implementation Details

- Centralized metadata key constants in `types` package for consistency
- Updated all references throughout the codebase to use centralized constants
- Generated new protobuf definitions with proper message types
- Comprehensive test coverage for RPC methods, HTTP endpoints, and error cases

## Current Metadata Keys

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `d` | DA included height - height of the data availability layer that has been included |
| `l` | Last batch data - last batch data submitted to the data availability layer |
| `last-submitted-header-height` | Last submitted header height to DA |
| `last-submitted-data-height` | Last submitted data height to DA |

Fixes #2386.

3256509471,605,BUS-1495: Implement Snowflake adapter streaming with network-level row limiting,"# BUS-1495: Implement Snowflake adapter streaming with network-level row limiting

## Summary

Implemented streaming functionality in the Snowflake adapter to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors when handling large query results. The key change replaces the previous approach of fetching all rows into memory then limiting client-side with true network-level row limiting using the Snowflake Node.js driver's streaming capabilities.

**Key Changes:**
- Modified `SnowflakeAdapter.query()` to use `streamResult: true` and `stmt.streamRows({ start: 0, end: limit })`
- Added default 5000 row limit when `maxRows` is not specified or is 0
- Implemented stream event handling for 'data', 'error', and 'end' events
- Updated unit tests to mock streaming behavior
- Fixed integration test property names and imports
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing adapter interface

## Review & Testing Checklist for Human

⚠️ **HIGH RISK** - This PR makes significant changes to core query execution logic and requires thorough testing.

- [x] **Test with real Snowflake credentials** - Verify that streaming actually works end-to-end with a real Snowflake connection (most critical)
- [x] **Validate Snowflake SDK streaming API** - Confirm that `stmt.streamRows({ start, end })` parameters and stream events match the actual SDK behavior
- [x] **Test edge cases** - Empty result sets, query errors, connection failures, and results exactly equal to the limit
- [x] **Verify backward compatibility** - Ensure existing code using the adapter continues to work without changes
- [x] **Confirm default behavior change** - Validate that the new 5000 row default limit is acceptable for existing use cases

**Recommended Test Plan:**
1. Run integration tests with real Snowflake credentials
2. Test queries with various row counts (< 5000, = 5000, > 5000)
3. Test with and without explicit `maxRows` parameter
4. Verify query caching still works as expected
5. Test error scenarios (invalid SQL, connection issues)

### Notes

**Critical Risk**: This implementation is based on assumptions about the Snowflake Node.js SDK streaming API that haven't been validated against a real Snowflake connection. The `streamRows` method parameters, return types, and event handling could differ from the actual SDK behavior.

**Behavioral Change**: The adapter now applies row limits at the network level instead of fetching all rows then limiting in memory. This is the desired behavior for preventing OOM, but represents a significant change in how the adapter works internally.

## Summary

Modified the PGliteInstanceManager to close PGLite instances immediately after query execution instead of keeping them in memory per session. This change reduces memory usage by not holding database instances in memory between queries.

<img width=""767"" alt=""スクリーンショット 2025-06-12 15 42 16"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8defb768-553b-4818-ade0-4ec5d8a9096d"" />


## Changes Made

- **PGliteInstanceManager.ts**: 
  - Removed session-based instance storage (`Map<string, PGliteInstance>`)
  - Removed automatic cleanup interval and related methods
  - Modified `executeQuery` to create new instances per query and close them in a `finally` block
  - Simplified class structure by removing unnecessary session management

- **types.ts**: 
  - Removed unused `PGliteInstance` interface
  - Cleaned up unused imports

## Technical Details

### Before
- Instances were stored in a Map by sessionId
- Automatic cleanup removed inactive instances after 30 minutes
- Memory usage accumulated over time with multiple sessions

### After
- New instance created for each query execution
- Instance closed immediately after query completion using try/finally
- Zero memory accumulation between queries
- Maintains API compatibility (sessionId parameter kept but unused)

## Testing

- ✅ Lint checks pass (Biome, ESLint, TypeScript)
- ✅ Build successful
- ⏳ CI checks pending

## Breaking Changes

None - the public API remains unchanged. The `executeQuery` function signature is identical.

## Memory Impact

This change should significantly reduce memory usage, especially for applications with:
- Multiple concurrent sessions
- Long-running processes
- Infrequent database queries

3236323443,11344,🐞 Fix tree performance: only render children when parent is expanded,"## Problem

The tree component was rendering all children (and children of all nested children) regardless of whether their parents were expanded. This caused severe performance issues when dealing with large datasets, especially when rendering trees in dropdowns.

Consider a tree with 3000 nested items:
- **Before**: All 3000 components rendered immediately on load
- **After**: Only visible/expanded components rendered (typically 3-10)

## Root Cause

In `tree.template.html`, the `*ngFor` directive was rendering all children without checking the parent tree-item's expansion state:

```html
<tui-tree
    *ngFor=""let child of children; trackBy: trackBy""
    [content]=""content""
    [trackBy]=""trackBy""
    [value]=""child""
/>
```

## Solution

Added conditional rendering to only create child components when the parent is expanded:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf=""!item || item.isExpanded"">
    <tui-tree
        *ngFor=""let child of children; trackBy: trackBy""
        [content]=""content""
        [trackBy]=""trackBy""
        [value]=""child""
    />
</ng-container>
```

**Key aspects:**
- Uses existing `item.isExpanded` getter from tree-item component
- Handles initialization edge case with `!item` condition  
- Preserves all existing functionality and APIs
- No breaking changes

## Performance Impact

For a tree with 3000 items using `[tuiTreeController]=""false""`:
- **Memory usage**: Dramatically reduced (only visible components instantiated)
- **Initial render time**: Significantly faster
- **User experience**: Smooth interactions, especially in dropdowns

## Verified Scenarios

✅ Trees with `[tuiTreeController]=""true""` (expanded by default)  
✅ Trees with `[tuiTreeController]=""false""` (collapsed by default)  
✅ Programmatic expansion/collapse  
✅ Nested array data structures  
✅ Object-based data structures with children handlers  
✅ TrackBy functions still work  
✅ Content projection still works

3107779459,3401,Migrate Figma plugin to support dynamic page loading API,"## Overview

This PR migrates the Tokens Studio for Figma plugin to support Figma's new dynamic page loading API, improving performance for large files by loading pages on-demand rather than loading all pages upfront.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Plugin Manifest
- Added `""documentAccess"": ""dynamic-page""` to `manifest.json` to enable dynamic page loading

### 2. Replaced Synchronous API Calls with Asynchronous Equivalents
- Converted `figma.getNodeById()` to `figma.getNodeByIdAsync()` in:
  - `node.ts` - `goToNode()` and `selectNodes()` functions
  - `NodeManager.ts` - `getNode()` method
  - `removeTokensByValue.ts` - node lookup operations
  - `setNoneValuesOnNode.ts` - node update operations

### 3. Added Dynamic Page Loading Support
- Added `await figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` calls before accessing `figma.root.children` in:
  - `swapStyles.ts` - before document-wide style operations
  - `NodeManager.ts` - before document-wide node traversal

### 4. Updated Function Signatures
- Made functions async where they now use async Figma API calls
- Updated calling code to properly await these functions

### 5. Enhanced Test Infrastructure
- Added mock implementations for new async methods:
  - `mockGetNodeByIdAsync`
  - `mockLoadAllPagesAsync`
- Updated test files to use async patterns

## Impact

### Performance Benefits
- Large Figma files will load faster as pages are loaded on-demand
- Reduced memory usage for documents with many pages
- Better responsiveness when working with complex documents

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Plugin behavior remains the same from user perspective
- No breaking changes to the UI or workflow

### Code Quality
- Minimal changes: only 11 files modified with surgical precision
- All tests passing with new async implementation
- Clean separation between sync and async operations where appropriate

## Testing

- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New async methods properly mocked and tested
- ✅ Build verification completed successfully for both development and production
- ✅ Linting passes without issues

## Technical Details

The migration follows Figma's recommended patterns for dynamic page loading:

1. **Document Access Declaration**: The manifest now declares `""documentAccess"": ""dynamic-page""`
2. **Async Node Access**: Uses `getNodeByIdAsync()` for reliable node access across pages
3. **Page Loading**: Calls `loadAllPagesAsync()` before any document-wide operations
4. **Error Handling**: Maintains existing error handling patterns while adding async support

This ensures the plugin is future-proof and compatible with Figma's performance optimizations while maintaining all current functionality.

3119099358,3412,Optimize theme application performance for deeply nested components,"## Problem

When applying themes to complex components with deeply nested instances (e.g., data tables, full page dashboards), the plugin would scan every child layer within the selection, including those not immediately visible or directly targeted. This ""deep scan"" behavior resulted in extremely long processing times (30-60 minutes or more) and could cause Figma to freeze or become unresponsive.

## Root Cause

The `applySiblingStyleId` function was recursively traversing ALL children of nodes without checking if they actually contained relevant styles that needed to be swapped. This created an exponential traversal pattern where deeply nested structures would be processed entirely, even when most nodes had no theme-related styles.

## Solution

This PR implements several key optimizations:

1. **Style Relevance Checking**: Added `hasRelevantStyleId()` helper that checks if a style ID exists in the theme mapping before processing
2. **Smart Child Traversal**: Added `nodeHasRelevantStyles()` to determine if a subtree contains relevant styles before recursing
3. **Early Exit Conditions**: Skip processing nodes and their children when no relevant styles are detected
4. **Reduced API Calls**: Only process style IDs that exist in the theme mapping, avoiding unnecessary `getNewStyleId()` calls

## Performance Impact

- **Deeply nested structures with few styled elements**: Dramatic performance improvement (potentially orders of magnitude faster)
- **Structures with many styled elements**: Minimal overhead while maintaining correctness
- **No functional changes**: Theme application behavior remains exactly the same

## Example

Before:
```typescript
// Would process ALL children regardless of style relevance
await Promise.all(node.children.map((child) => applySiblingStyleId(child, styleIds, styleMap, activeThemes)));
```

After:
```typescript
// Only process children if they might contain relevant styles
const shouldProcessChildren = node.children.some((child) => 
  nodeHasRelevantStyles(child) || ('children' in child && child.children.length > 0)
);

if (shouldProcessChildren) {
  await Promise.all(node.children.map((child) => applySiblingStyleId(child, styleIds, styleMap, activeThemes)));
}
```

## Testing

- Added comprehensive test coverage for the optimization logic
- Verified that existing functionality remains unchanged
- All existing tests continue to pass

Fixes #3409.

3084701052,97,Add community profile and like button to ThemeView,"# Optimize theme fetching with single database query

This PR optimizes the community profile and like button functionality in the ThemeView component by fetching both theme and community theme data in a single database query.

## Changes

- Created a new function `getThemeWithCommunity` in actions/themes.ts that fetches theme and community theme data in one efficient query
- Updated app/themes/[themeId]/page.tsx to use the optimized function instead of making sequential requests
- Fixed type safety issues to ensure proper null handling for community theme data
- Added proper error handling for cases where theme doesn't exist

## Benefits

- Reduces the number of database queries from two to one
- Improves performance by eliminating extra network requests
- Maintains the same UI functionality with better performance

## Testing

I was unable to test the changes locally due to a missing DATABASE_URL environment variable, but the implementation follows the same pattern as the community-theme-preview-dialog.tsx component which is already working in the feature/community branch.

3071083616,137,feat: replace SQLite with DuckDB,"This PR replaces SQLite with DuckDB.

SQLite is great but suffers from a number of issues that make it unsuitable for local RAG:
1. ❌ SQLite's best vector search extension is probably [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec), but [extensions are blocked by default on macOS](https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vec/python.html#macos-blocks-sqlite-extensions-by-default).
2. ❌ The sqlite-vec extension also still [doesn't have an accelerated index](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec/issues/25) such as a HNSW index, which means its limited to around a million document chunks.
3. ❌ SQLite's built-in full-text search extension [FTS5](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html) doesn't offer BM25 scoring.

On the other hand:
1. ✅ DuckDB has an easily installable vector search extension called [VSS](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/vss.html). 
2. ✅ The VSS extension has accelerated HNSW indexes with experimental support for persistence to disk.
3. ✅ DuckDB has an easily installable full-text search extension called [FTS](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/full_text_search). The only downside to this index is that it needs to be updated manually after inserting, updating, or removing document chunks.


Changes:
1. Simplify the `_typing.py` module and make it more easier to add support for other databases.
2. Update `keyword_search` to use BM25 when using DuckDB.
3. Simplify `vector_search` to a single implementation for both DuckDB and PostgreSQL.
4. Update DuckDB's full-text index after document insertion.
5. Add tests for in-memory and repeated DuckDB database creation.
6. Reintroduce support for the `dot` and `l2` metrics.
7. Add a dependency on `duckdb` and `duckdb-engine`, DuckDB's SQLAlchemy driver.
8. Remove the dependencies on PyNNDescent and Numba.
9. Install and configure clang(++) as the default compilers for llama-cpp-python to fix an issue with local development with Dev Containers on macOS.
