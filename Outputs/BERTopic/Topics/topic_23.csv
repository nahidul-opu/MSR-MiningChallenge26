3239263606,6472,Optimize draw shape pressure property,"This PR refactors how draw shape point pressure is stored and handled, leading to storage optimization and improved clarity.

Previously, pressure was stored as a float `0-1` in the `z` property of a point, with `0` or `0.5` indicating no pressure. This update changes the storage to:
1.  **Omit the `z` property entirely** when no pressure information is available (e.g., mouse input).
2.  Store pressure as an **integer between `0` and `100`** when pressure is provided (e.g., pen/stylus input).

A new migration (`OptimizePressure: 3`) is included to safely convert existing draw shapes to the new format, ensuring backward and forward compatibility. This change reduces the data size of draw shapes and makes the pressure values more intuitive.

### Change type

- [ ] `bugfix`
- [x] `improvement`
- [ ] `feature`
- [ ] `api`
- [ ] `other`

### Test plan

1.  **Draw with mouse:**
    *   Select the draw tool.
    *   Draw a shape using a mouse.
    *   Verify the shape is drawn correctly. (Internally, points should *not* have a `z` property).
2.  **Draw with pen/stylus (if applicable):**
    *   Select the draw tool.
    *   Draw a shape using a pen or stylus with varying pressure.
    *   Verify the shape's stroke width changes with pressure. (Internally, points *should* have a `z` property with an integer value between 0-100).
3.  **Load old files:**
    *   Open a file created before this PR with draw shapes.
    *   Verify the draw shapes load and display correctly, and their pressure values are migrated.

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] End to end tests

### Release notes

- Optimized draw shapes by storing pressure as an integer (0-100) only when provided, reducing file size and improving data clarity.

3250477735,397,Optimize nancorrmatrix and nancovmatrix for cache locality,"Refactor `nancorrmatrix` and `nancovmatrix` to process observations sequentially. This improves cache locality by reducing random memory access patterns, leading to better performance.

The previous implementation iterated over variable pairs, then observations, resulting in scattered memory access. The new approach iterates over observations first, loading an entire observation into cache, then processing all variable pairs for that observation. This reduces cache misses significantly.

Also adds new benchmark parameters to test these functions with larger inputs.

2892658334,493,Add Memory Bucket Optimizer Tool,"# Memory Bucket Optimizer Tool for wolfSSL

This PR adds a memory bucket optimizer tool for wolfSSL's static memory feature. The tool analyzes malloc sizes from the wolfSSL example client and suggests optimal bucket configurations to minimize wasted memory overhead.

## Features
- Analyzes malloc sizes from the wolfSSL example client
- Suggests optimal bucket configurations to minimize wasted memory overhead
- Orders bucket sizes from smallest to largest
- Works with different TLS operations (TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, different servers)
- Includes visualization with gnuplot charts
- Supports testing with WOLFSSL_NO_MALLOC for embedded systems

## IDE Parsing Issues
During development, we noticed that some IDEs report syntax errors in wolfSSL header files (memory.h, ssl.h) and implementation files (memory.c). These errors are **NOT** related to our memory bucket optimizer changes but are rather due to the IDE's inability to properly parse the complex conditional compilation directives in the wolfSSL codebase.

These syntax errors are purely IDE parsing issues and do not indicate actual code problems. They are a result of the complex conditional compilation structure of the wolfSSL codebase, which is designed to support multiple platforms, configurations, and feature sets. The code compiles and runs correctly despite these IDE errors.

3125710825,1936,feat: update parts channel capacity from 1000 to 2500,"Updates the parts channel capacity from 1000 to 2500 to prevent blocking during processing of large blocks (128MB).

## Changes

- Increased `partsChan` buffer capacity from 1000 to 2500 in all relevant files:
  - `node/node.go` - Main production code where the parts channel is created
  - `consensus/reactor_test.go` - Test files using the parts channel
  - `consensus/propagation/reactor_test.go`
  - `consensus/propagation/commitment_test.go`
  - `consensus/wal_generator.go`
  - `consensus/byzantine_test.go`
  - `consensus/replay_file.go`
  - `consensus/common_test.go`

## Problem

The current capacity of 1000 can cause blocking when processing large 128MB blocks, which adds unnecessary complexity to the consensus mechanism and can impact performance.

## Solution

Increasing the channel capacity to 2500 provides sufficient buffer space to handle large block processing without blocking, simplifying the consensus flow and improving performance for large blocks.

Fixes #1923.

3181043136,2404,feat: Implement configurable batch queue throttling to prevent resource exhaustion,"## Problem

The `BatchQueue` implementation in `sequencers/single/queue.go` had **no size limits**, leading to potential resource exhaustion and system instability. During DA congestion or connection issues, batches would accumulate faster than they could be processed, causing:

- **Unbounded memory growth** from unlimited slice expansion
- **Unbounded disk usage** from persistent storage without cleanup
- **No backpressure mechanism** to signal upstream components when overwhelmed
- **Performance degradation** during restart recovery with large persistent queues

## Solution

Added configurable queue limits with graceful error handling while maintaining full backward compatibility:

### Key Changes

1. **New Error Type for Backpressure**
   ```go
   var ErrQueueFull = errors.New(""batch queue is full"")
   ```

2. **Enhanced BatchQueue Structure**
   ```go
   type BatchQueue struct {
       queue        []coresequencer.Batch
       maxQueueSize int // 0 = unlimited for backward compatibility
       mu           sync.Mutex
       db           ds.Batching
   }
   ```

3. **Throttling Logic in AddBatch**
   ```go
   // Check if queue is full (maxQueueSize of 0 means unlimited)
   if bq.maxQueueSize > 0 && len(bq.queue) >= bq.maxQueueSize {
       return ErrQueueFull
   }
   ```

4. **Production-Ready Defaults**
   - Set default limit of 1000 batches in single sequencer
   - Enhanced error logging when queue reaches capacity
   - Graceful error propagation with informative messages

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing tests use `maxSize: 0` (unlimited) to maintain current behavior
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to public APIs

### Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test suites covering:
- Various queue size limits (unlimited, within limit, at limit, exceeding limit)
- Queue behavior after batch processing (demonstrates backpressure relief)
- Thread safety under concurrent load (100 workers, 10 queue limit)
- End-to-end integration testing with sequencer

**Coverage increased from 76.7% to 78.0%**

### Example Behavior

```go
// During normal operation
queue := NewBatchQueue(db, ""batches"", 1000)
err := queue.AddBatch(ctx, batch) // ✅ Success

// During DA congestion (queue full)
err := queue.AddBatch(ctx, batch) // ❌ Returns ErrQueueFull

// After DA processes batches
batch, _ := queue.Next(ctx)       // Frees space
err = queue.AddBatch(ctx, batch)  // ✅ Success again
```

This prevents the resource exhaustion scenarios while allowing normal operation and providing clear backpressure signals to upstream components.

Fixes #2252.
