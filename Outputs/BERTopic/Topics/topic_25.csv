3128534413,7,Implement Salsa-based incremental compilation,"## Summary
This PR implements Salsa-based incremental compilation infrastructure for the rue compiler, enabling IDE-friendly incremental updates.

## Changes
- **Salsa Database Setup**: Added basic `RueDatabase` type alias using Salsa's `DatabaseImpl`
- **Incremental File Parsing**: Implemented `parse_file` as a Salsa tracked function that automatically caches results
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added tests to verify incremental behavior works correctly (caching unchanged results)
- **API Fixes**: Updated example file to use current API and added `PartialEq` to `ParseError` for Salsa compatibility

## Key Benefits
- **Fast Recompilation**: Only recomputes changed files and their dependents
- **IDE Support**: Foundation for Language Server Protocol implementation
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic result caching and invalidation
- **Expression-level Granularity**: Future support for fine-grained incremental computation

## Testing
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New incremental compilation tests verify caching behavior
- Both Buck2 and Cargo builds work correctly

## Architecture
```rust
// Salsa input (can be modified)
#[salsa::input]
pub struct SourceFile { /* path, text */ }

// Salsa tracked function (automatically cached)
#[salsa::tracked]
pub fn parse_file(db: &dyn Database, file: SourceFile) -> Result<Arc<CstRoot>, Arc<ParseError>>

// Usage - Salsa handles caching automatically
let result = parse_file(&db, file);
file.set_text(&mut db).to(new_content); // Invalidates cache
let new_result = parse_file(&db, file); // Recomputes only if needed
```

## Next Steps
This establishes the foundation for:
- Semantic analysis queries
- Type checking
- Name resolution
- Code generation
- LSP implementation

3159661875,183,Refactor REPL to eliminate temporary file usage,"The REPL implementation was using a ""huge hack"" of creating temporary files to conform with the existing compilation interface that expects a `BufRead` object. This approach was inefficient and unnecessary.

## Changes Made

This PR replaces the temporary file usage with `std::io::Cursor<Vec<u8>>` which implements `BufRead` and can be created directly from string content:

**Before:**
```rust
// Create temporary file
let file_res = tempfile();
let mut file = file_res.unwrap();
file.write_all(line.as_bytes());
file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0));
let mut bufread: Box<dyn BufRead> = Box::new(BufReader::new(file));
```

**After:**
```rust
// Create in-memory buffer
let mut bufread: Box<dyn BufRead> = Box::new(Cursor::new(line.into_bytes()));
```

## Impact

- **REPL input processing**: No longer creates temporary files for each command
- **Expression evaluation (`-e` option)**: No longer creates temporary files for expressions
- **Code reduction**: Removed 43 lines of error-prone file I/O code, added only 6 lines
- **Performance**: Eliminates filesystem operations for every REPL interaction
- **Reliability**: Removes potential issues with temporary file creation/cleanup

## Testing

Verified that:
- REPL functionality works identically to before
- Expression evaluation with `-e` flag works correctly
- Error handling remains functional
- No temporary files are created during operation
- Edge cases (empty input, whitespace) are handled properly

The refactoring successfully maintains compatibility with the existing compilation interface while eliminating the temporary file dependency.

Fixes #8.

3221072168,7714,Replace [KnownBuiltin] string-based comparisons with enum-based system,"This PR replaces the inefficient string-based `[KnownBuiltin]` identification system with a fast enum-based approach, addressing performance issues and improving type safety throughout the Slang compiler.

## Problem

The current `KnownBuiltin` attribute system uses string comparisons to identify intrinsic functions:

```cpp
// Before: Inefficient string comparison
if (getBuiltinFuncName(callee) != UnownedStringSlice::fromLiteral(""GeometryStreamAppend""))
```

This approach has several issues:
- **Performance**: O(n) string comparisons vs O(1) integer comparisons
- **Type Safety**: No compile-time validation of builtin names
- **Maintainability**: Magic strings scattered throughout codebase

## Solution

Implemented a centralized enum-based system:

```cpp
// After: Fast enum comparison  
if (getBuiltinFuncEnum(callee) != KnownBuiltinDeclName::GeometryStreamAppend)
```

### Key Changes

1. **Added `KnownBuiltinDeclName` enum** in `slang-ast-support-types.h` covering all 10 known builtins:
   - Geometry shaders: `GeometryStreamAppend`, `GeometryStreamRestart`
   - Vertex processing: `GetAttributeAtVertex`, `DispatchMesh`  
   - CUDA cooperation: `saturated_cooperation`, `saturated_cooperation_using`
   - Autodiff: `IDifferentiable`, `IDifferentiablePtr`, `IDifferentiablePtrType`, `NullDifferential`

2. **Updated `IRKnownBuiltinDecoration`** to store `IRIntLit` (enum value) instead of `IRStringLit`

3. **Dual API approach**:
   - New `getBuiltinFuncEnum()` for performance-critical code
   - Legacy `getBuiltinFuncName()` maintained for backward compatibility

4. **Updated all comparison sites** across 6 IR processing files to use enum comparisons

### Benefits

- **Performance**: Enum comparisons are significantly faster than string comparisons
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents typos in builtin names
- **Maintainability**: Centralized enum definition makes adding new builtins easier

## Testing

- ✅ All 284 language-feature tests pass
- ✅ IR processing and geometry shader tests validated
- ✅ Added specific test for KnownBuiltin attribute processing
- ✅ Maintains 100% backward compatibility

The implementation provides substantial performance improvements while preserving all existing functionality.

Fixes #7667.
