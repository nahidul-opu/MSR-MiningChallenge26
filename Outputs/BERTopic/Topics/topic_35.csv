3090482540,4355,[Failed] Unable to enable browser notifications immediately after visiting the web page for the first time,"Thanks for assigning this issue to me. I'm starting to work on it and will keep this PR's description up to date as I form a plan and make progress.

Original issue description:

> ### Share your bug report, feature request, or comment.
> 
> If you try to enable browser notifications right after visiting an Owncast web page for the first time, you'll get a long loading spinner, and sometimes it'll time out.
> 
> I believe this is because it's waiting for the service worker to free up, but the service worker is busy in the background pre-downloading a bunch of assets.
> 
> I wonder if we can tell the service worker to stop anything its doing if somebody is trying to enable notifications. It's far more important than caching any of those assets. The reason I set that up to cache assets in the first place was so we wouldn't see loading spinners when you open up modals or other views that are asynchronously loaded, or wait for the emoji to load in one at a time. But if somebody had to cancel that to register for push notifications, it's really no big deal.


Fixes #4195.

## Summary by CodeRabbit

* **New Features**
  * Introduced an optional browser service worker to cache dashboard assets, improving load performance and enabling offline support for previously visited resources.
  * Added a configuration option to enable or disable the service worker via the dashboard settings.
  * Service worker automatically unregisters and clears cache when all dashboard tabs are closed to ensure updates are received.

* **Documentation**
  * Updated documentation to describe the new browser service worker feature and its configuration.
