3235395709,34529,Fix file save blocking on entry refresh for improved hot reload performance,"## Summary

Fixes file save operations blocking on filesystem entry refresh, which was causing hot reload systems to detect file changes later than other editors like VS Code or Sublime Text.

## Changes

Modified `LocalWorktree::write_file` in `crates/worktree/src/worktree.rs` to make the `refresh_entry` call non-blocking by moving it to a background task. The save operation now completes immediately after the file write, with filesystem state refresh happening asynchronously.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the save flow where:
1. File gets written to disk (`write.await?`)
2. Save completion waits for `refresh_entry().await?` to finish
3. `refresh_entry` sends a scan request to background thread and waits
4. Only then does the save operation return success

This blocking behavior delayed the save completion signal that hot reload tools rely on.

## Solution

- Start refresh task without awaiting it
- Spawn refresh in background with `.detach()`
- Return success immediately after file write
- Use existing entry state when available

## Testing

User reported that the fix resolved the hot reload delay issue after building and testing the changes.

3168705723,1636,Implement retry-after header handling for improved throttling in fetch requests,"Currently, genaiscript handles throttling situations but does not respect the `retry-after` header returned by services. This leads to unnecessary load on throttled services and suboptimal user experience with exponential backoff delays that may be longer than needed.

## Changes Made

This PR implements proper `retry-after` header handling in the fetch retry logic:

### 1. Added `parseRetryAfter()` function
- Supports both integer seconds format: `retry-after: 120` 
- Supports HTTP date format: `retry-after: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT`
- Handles edge cases: negative values, invalid inputs, past dates, whitespace
- Returns `null` for invalid inputs to fallback to exponential backoff

### 2. Enhanced retry logic in `createFetch()`
- Checks for `retry-after` header in HTTP responses during retries
- Uses server-specified delay instead of calculated exponential backoff when available
- Falls back to existing exponential backoff when no `retry-after` header is present
- Respects `maxDelay` configuration to prevent excessive waits

### 3. Improved user transparency
- Displays retry-after information in log messages
- Format: `retry #1 in 120.0s (retry-after: 120s)` vs `retry #1 in 2.0s`
- Users can now see the actual reason and duration for delays

## Example Behavior

**Before:**
```
retry #1 in 2.0s 429 Too Many Requests
retry #2 in 3.0s 429 Too Many Requests  
retry #3 in 4.5s 429 Too Many Requests
```

**After (with retry-after: 60):**
```
retry #1 in 60.0s (retry-after: 60s) 429 Too Many Requests
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Reduces unnecessary load on throttled services by respecting server timing
- ✅ Provides transparency to users about wait times and reasons
- ✅ Maintains full backward compatibility with existing retry behavior
- ✅ Handles common throttling scenarios (HTTP 429, 503, etc.)
- ✅ RFC 7231 compliant retry-after header parsing

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Integer seconds parsing (`""120""` → 120 seconds)
- HTTP date parsing (future dates with proper time calculation)
- Edge cases (negative values, invalid strings, past dates)
- Whitespace handling and input validation

Fixes #1629.

3242174192,6617,feat: implement async timeout for segments with cache support,"## Overview

This PR implements asynchronous segment execution with caching support to address performance issues in large repositories, specifically targeting issue #6094. The feature allows segments to execute with configurable timeouts, using cached data when operations exceed the threshold while updating the cache in the background.

## Problem

Users working with large monorepos experience slow prompt rendering due to expensive operations like `git status` that can take several seconds. Current workarounds involve disabling status checks, which sacrifices important information in the prompt.

## Solution

### Core Features

1. **Async Timeout Configuration**: New `async_timeout` field for segments
2. **Intelligent Caching**: Cached segment data with background refresh
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Use cached data when operations exceed timeout
4. **Background Updates**: Non-blocking cache refresh for next prompt

### Implementation Details

- **Configuration**: Added `async_timeout` field to segment configuration (in nanoseconds)
- **Cache Management**: New `AsyncSegmentCache` system for persistent segment data
- **Background Processes**: Automatic cache refresh without blocking prompt rendering
- **CLI Support**: Cache management commands for debugging and maintenance

### Usage Example

```json
{
  ""type"": ""git"",
  ""style"": ""plain"",
  ""async_timeout"": 100,
  ""properties"": {
    ""fetch_status"": true
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **First Run**: Segment executes normally, result is cached
2. **Subsequent Runs**: 
   - If execution completes within timeout → use fresh data, update cache
   - If execution exceeds timeout → use cached data, start background refresh
3. **Background Refresh**: Cache is updated asynchronously for next prompt

## Benefits

- **Instant Prompts**: Cached data provides immediate rendering
- **Fresh Data**: Background updates ensure information stays current
- **Configurable**: Per-segment timeout configuration
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing configurations work unchanged

## Testing

- ✅ Unit tests for async timeout configuration
- ✅ Cache management functionality tests
- ✅ Integration tests with git segments
- ✅ CLI command validation
- ✅ Configuration loading from JSON/YAML

## Files Changed

- `src/config/segment.go` - Core async execution logic
- `src/cache/async.go` - Async cache management system
- `src/cli/cache.go` - CLI cache refresh commands
- `src/config/async_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite
- `src/config/async_config_test.go` - Configuration loading tests

## Migration

No breaking changes. The feature is opt-in via the new `async_timeout` configuration field.

## Future Enhancements

This implementation provides the foundation for the full async prompt system mentioned in #6094. Future work could include:
- Shell-specific async prompt integration
- Advanced cache invalidation strategies
- Performance monitoring and metrics

Closes #6094

3228266614,7288,Implement exponential backoff for Copilot refresh after commenting on Padawan PRs,"When commenting on Copilot-assigned PRs, the timeline refresh now uses exponential backoff with early exit detection to show newly launched Copilot sessions more responsively.

## Problem

Previously, when a user commented on a Copilot-assigned PR, the extension would wait a fixed 1 second before refreshing the timeline to show the newly launched Copilot session. This caused delays since it takes time to determine and launch the session on GitHub.com.

## Solution

Implemented exponential backoff with retry intervals of 500ms, 1s, 2s, and 5s that:

- **Captures initial timeline state** before starting retries
- **Polls for new `CopilotStarted` events** on each retry
- **Exits early** when a new Copilot session is detected
- **Gracefully handles errors** during timeline fetching
- **Falls back to single refresh** if no new events are found

## Key Benefits

- **Faster response** when Copilot sessions start quickly (500ms vs 1s minimum)
- **Better user experience** by showing sessions immediately when available
- **Server-friendly** with reasonable retry intervals that avoid excessive load
- **Maintains reliability** with fallback behavior
- **Backwards compatible** with existing functionality

## Implementation Details

The `tryScheduleCopilotRefresh` method in `src/github/issueOverview.ts` now:

```typescript
// Before: Fixed 1-second wait
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
if (!this._isDisposed) {
    this.refreshPanel();
}

// After: Exponential backoff with early exit
const delays = [500, 1000, 2000, 5000];
for (const delay of delays) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    
    const currentTimeline = await this._getTimeline();
    const currentCopilotStartedEvents = currentTimeline.filter(event => 
        event.event === EventType.CopilotStarted);
    
    if (currentCopilotStartedEvents.length > initialCopilotStartedEvents.length) {
        this.refreshPanel();
        return; // Early exit when new event found
    }
}
```

## Testing

- Added comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases
- Verified exponential backoff timing and early exit logic
- Confirmed backwards compatibility with existing behavior
- All existing tests continue to pass

Fixes #7231.
