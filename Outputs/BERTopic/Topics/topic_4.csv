2905716327,9027,refactor(twap): implement strategy pattern for accumulator updates,"This commit refactors the TWAP module to use the strategy pattern more thoroughly for its accumulator updates. Previously, the strategy pattern was only used for TWAP computation but not for the accumulator updates.

Key changes:
- Add `updateAccumulators` method to the twapStrategy interface
- Implement strategy-specific accumulator update logic for both arithmetic and geometric strategies
- Modify `getInterpolatedRecord` to use the provided strategy's accumulator update method
- Update remaining code to use the appropriate strategy for accumulator updates
- Maintain backward compatibility in exported functions and existing code paths

With this change, geometric accumulator calculations are now only performed when using the geometric strategy, making the system more efficient by avoiding unnecessary calculations for the arithmetic strategy.

3124191731,8572,HDDS-13114. Make MaxSubCompactions configureable for manual compaction,"## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8141#discussion_r2093792426

 
In https://github.com/apache/ozone/pull/8141 `RDBStore#compactTable` was introduced. 

We should set `options.setMaxCompactionBytes()` when we open the snapshot rocksdb this could be useful so that we ensure one sub compaction doesn't take up a lot of memory. Also look into making ManagedCompactRangeOptions.setMaxSubCompactions() configurable so that we don't use a lot of CPU for this operation. It is ok if the compactions take time.

This can be achieved by adding `ManagedRangeCompactionOption` into `AbstractRDBStore`, `RDBStore`, `RDBStoreBuilder`. Also the corresponding rocksdb config keys.
