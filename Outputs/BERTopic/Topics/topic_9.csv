Body: mentions adding runtime helper for hashing struct keys, track element types for query variables when compiling, generate struct keys for grouped queries when key is a map literal. This seems about compilation improvements, maybe performance? It might be about query compilation speed or memory usage? The description doesn't mention speed, latency, optimization explicitly. It's about query compilation improvements, maybe to reduce compile time or memory usage. But the classification guidelines: performance-related PRs may contain keywords such as latency, optimization, slow, react, wait, memory, speed, responsive, minor, tim, instant, latenc, leak, lag, respons, stuck, perf, compile-time-hog, fast, hang, throughput, performance, perform, or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs.

The guidelines say performance-related PRs may contain keywords such as... or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs. The phrase ""Improve TPCH query compilation"" could be considered performance improvement. But it's ambiguous. The guidelines: ""Performance-related pull requests may contain keywords such as... or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs."" So if the PR is about improving compilation, that is a performance improvement. But the guidelines also say ""or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs."" The phrase ""Improve TPCH query compilation"" is indeed about improving compilation, which is a performance aspect. But the guidelines might want explicit mention of performance.

But the guidelines mention ""or any other terms referring to how faster and efficiently software runs."" So ""Improve TPCH query compilation"" is indeed a term referring to performance. So likely classify as performance.

But let's consider if it's about correctness or feature addition. The changes: add runtime helper for hashing struct keys, track element types for query variables when compiling, generate struct keys for grouped queries when key is a map literal. This is about query compilation, maybe to reduce compile time or memory usage. It's not about adding new features or bug fixes. It's about improving compilation. That is a performance improvement.
